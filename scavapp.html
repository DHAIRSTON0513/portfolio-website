          <h1>Project Summary</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>ScavApp is an application meant to connect people with their friends and surroundings through scavenger hunts. Users can search for pre-made scavenger hunts that are ready to play at any time. Or, if they are looking for a more
            personalized experience, they can take part in our guided process that facilitates creating a scavenger hunt. Once a game is chosen, customized and scheduled, the players can also use this application when it is time to play. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
          <p>ScavApp was a personal project I completed as part of my UX Immersion Course through CareerFoundry.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The objective of this project was to learn the detailed step by step process of designing an app completely from scratch. By the end, I had a prototype and full case study for my portfolio that demonstrated the skills and knowledge I
            learned throughout the course.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3>Duration</h3>
              <p>Though this project was self-paced, we were expected to complete the course within 7 months. I was able to complete it in 4.5 months. </p>
            </div>

        <!-- 1.Understand -->
        <h2>1. Understand</h2>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis & S.W.O.T Profile</h3>
        <p>Before designing my product, I needed to first research and understand the problem I was going to address. In order to determine this, I conducted a competitor analysis of GooseChase and Let’s Roam, the two leading scavenger hunt
          applications available, and summarized in their information into individual S.W.O.T profiles. This helped me to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, areas of improvement, and potential threats.</p>

        </div>
        <p>From this I developed a problem statement which, in turn, helped me to create a possible solution.</p>

      <div>
        <!-- 2.Observe -->
        <h2>2. Observe</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>User Interviews & Surveys</h3>
          <p>Once I had insight on my competitors, surveys and interviews were conducted in order to further understand users’s needs and goals. I interviewed people who matched my target audience demographics to find out if they have ever used an
            app like this, what their experience was like with those apps, areas of improvement, what they would like to get out of an app like this, etc. The research findings were summarized in the list below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="understand">
          <ul>
            <li>People like team scavenger hunts more over individual scavenger hunts.</li>
            <li> People seem to want to keep the hunt amongst their friend group. This is not really seen as a way to meet new people.</li>
            <li>Creating a scavenger hunt would be a lot of work. It would be nice to have an app that would provide the ground work.</li>
            <li>People are motivated through incentives.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a good balance in the difficulty level of the scavenger hunt.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>The problem statement was then updated to further coincide with the research findings listed above.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- 3. Point of View -->
        <h2>3. Point of View</h2>
        <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
        <p>All of the responses from the user interviews were written down on sticky notes with each color representing a different interview participant. These sticky notes were grouped based on similar themes then titles were assigned to each
          group to summarize these ideas. This affinity mapping helped me to understand trends in the thoughts and opinions of the potential user.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>User personas were created to connect the findings from the interviews I conducted to actual people who might use the app. I chose to create three different personas to acknowledge that people will be using this app for different
            purposes. I really wanted to make sure that these personas brought our users to life so I included their demographic information, activities they like to take part in, potential reasons for them using ScavApp, along with areas of
            motivation and frustrations with using the app. This information helped me to recognize and prioritize their needs as a user.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>User Journeys</h3>
          <p>From these user personas, I developed user journeys to help understand the steps the user will need to complete in order to accomplish their goals along with the thoughts and emotions they may experience. By understanding the step by
            step processes as well as the users thoughts and
            emotions, I could truly put myself in the shoes of the users.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>Once I understood the goals and needs of the user, I created user flows to demonstrate all of the pages the user would need to work through to accomplish their goals. To make sure I included all of the necessary steps, I established
            the
            entry point and the success criteria then filled in the steps from there. These created the foundation needed to begin
            developing
            the information architecture of the application.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Card Sorting & Sitemapping</h3>
          <p>Card sorting was performed get insight from potential users on how information should be grouped within the app. After multiple cards were labelled with different topics relating to the app, potential users were asked to group these
            cards together in a way that made sense to them. In the photo below, the darker the color and the higher the percentage, the more these themes were grouped together. The information gained from the card sorting was then used to develop
            a
            sitemap of how things will be grouped and structured in the application.</p>

        <h2>5. Prototype</h2>
        <p>Low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes were created using all of the information that was gathered and created in the previous steps. These wireframes were turned into prototypes to bring an element of interactivity and make it possible
          to
          perform user testing.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>Quick sketches were created to build a foundation of the core functionality of the app. The reason I started with sketckes was to make sure that a solid foundation was set. I did not want to get bogged down and distracted with the
            appearance of the app. A good foundation can make the difference between an app that only looks good and another app that looks good but is also user friendly.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Mid-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>Once the overall foundation was set, mid-fidelity wireframes were created using the program Balsamiq. These illustrated more functionality than the low-fidelity wireframes but did not have the the level of detail found in the
            high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>High-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>The last stage was to create high-fidelity wireframes using AdobeXD. These incorporated all of the functionality and also included the UI experience. These screens were mapped to create a prototype that was used for user testing.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Usability testing was performed after the creation of each type of wireframe fidelity. User testing was used to identify pain points and areas of improvement before handing off the design to the developers. It was important to make
              sure that errors were caught early in the design process because they are easier to fix at that time. For the actual testing, users were read scenarios then asked to complete tasks using the prototypes.</p>
            <h3>Affinity & Rainbow Mapping</h3>
            <p>The results from the high-fidelity usability tests were grouped together based on similar themes using affinity mapping. These themes were used in rainbow mapping to help illustrate the severity of the problem and to document possible
              solutions for these problems. From this spreadsheet, I was able to prioritize which issues to fix first using Jakob Nielsen's Error Severity Rating Scale. Those issues that were rated a "4" were usability issues that needed to be fixed
              before
              development.​​​​​​​</p>

            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p>After analyzing the results from the usability testing, changes were made to the prototype to address these pain points. Though changes were made there is always room for further iteration and improvement. Future iterations will include
              adding additional game types, providing more support while customizing games, adding animations, creating a mascot, polishing the UI design, and offering additional filter options.​​​​​​</p>
