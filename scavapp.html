        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>ScavApp is an application meant to connect people with their friends and surroundings through scavenger hunts. Users can search for pre-made scavenger hunts that are ready to play at any time. Or, if they are looking for a more
            personalized experience, they can take part in our guided process that facilitates creating a scavenger hunt. The players can also use this application when it is time to play, keeping players accountable and honest. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The objective of this project was to learn the detailed step by step process of designing an app completely from scratch. By the end, I had a prototype and full case study for my portfolio that demonstrated the skills and knowledge I
            learned throughout the course.</p>

        <!-- 1.Understand -->
        <h2>1. Understand</h2>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The first thing I needed to do was define the problem I was going to solve. Since there weren't any business requirements or metrics to guide me, there were some assumptions that were made regarding users' opinions of scavenger hunts. It was assumed that scavenger
          hunts are time consuming to set up, they have limited game play options, and it is difficult to keep people accountable and honest. With these assumptions in mind I came up with the following problem statement and possible solution.</p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/scavapp/problem-statement-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>It was important to define my target audience so I understood the users I was designing for. I wanted to target individuals that loved to explore their surroundings, be outside, and connect with others. I was looking at the age range of 18-35 as these ages tend to be tech savvy and have the freedom to get up and go.</p>
<span class="anchor" id="competitor-analysis"></span>
<div>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis & S.W.O.T Profile</h3>
        <p>Now that there was a problem statement to address, I conducted a competitor analysis of GooseChase and Let’s Roam, the two leading scavenger hunt applications on the market. I analyzed the following:
        <div class="testtacklr-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Key Objective: Their core message, how they present themselves, and how they set themselves apart from the competition.</li>
            <li>Overall Strategy: Their business strategy, the way in which they attract customers, and how they positions themselves against other companies.</li>
            <li>Marketing Advantage: What makes them better, faster, stronger, and more unique than the competition.</li>
            <li>Marketing Profile: What tools (i.e. blog) or social media they use.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This helped me to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, areas of improvement, and potential threats which I consolidated in the following S.W.O.T. profiles.</p>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/scavapp/lets-roam-swot-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
        </div>
        <p>I also noted other aspects of the website and/or app, including:</p>
        <div class="testtacklr-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Usability</li>
            <li>Layout</li>
            <li>Navigation Structure</li>
            <li>Compatibility</li>
            <li>Calls to Action</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p> From this competitor analysis I really wanted to understand what is currently on the market; what they have, what they don't have, and how I can make it better or fill that void.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- 2.Observe -->
        <h2>2. Observe</h2>
        <span class="anchor" id="user-surveys"></span>
        <div>
          <h3>User Surveys</h3>
          <p>Once I had insight on my competitors, a user survey was conducted in order to further understand additional needs and goals, but from a user perspective. I chose to do surveys at this stage because it was inexpensive,
            quick, and it set the foundation for further research. I was also able to get more responses which meant the results were more representive of the target audience. I surveyed people within my own network and through Slack who matched my target
            audience. I wanted to find out their attitudes towards outdoor scavenger hunts, attitudes using technology for scavenger hunts, if they view scavenger hunts as a way to connect to people, and what app features they would like to see.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/scavapp/survey-responses-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
        </div>
        <p>The findings from this survey include the following:</p>
      <div class="testtacklr-list">
          <ul>
            <li>People love having any reason to go outside.</li>
            <li>There is definitely an interest in trying a scavenger hunt and people think an app would facilitate this.</li>
            <li>People seem to want to keep the hunt amongst their friend group. This is not really seen as a way to meet new people.</li>
            <li>The game needs have a way of keeping people honest.</li>
            <li>The results need to be updated in real time.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <span class="anchor" id="user-interviews"></span>
        <div>
          <h3>User Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h3>
          <p>The results from the survey were used as the ground work for creating interview questions. I conducted user interviews with three participants to dive deeper into some of these themes.</p>
          <p>All of the responses from the user interviews were written down on sticky notes with each color representing a different interview participant. These sticky notes were grouped based on similar themes then titles were assigned to each
            group to summarize these ideas. This affinity map helped me to understand trends in the thoughts and opinions of the potential user.</p>

          </picture>
        </div>
        <p> The insights gained from this research are listed below: </p>
        <div class="testtacklr-list">
          <ul>
            <li>People like team scavenger hunts more over individual scavenger hunts.</li>
            <li>Creating a scavenger hunt would be a lot of work. It would be nice to have an app that would provide the ground work.</li>
            <li>People are motivated through incentives.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a good balance in the difficulty level of the scavenger hunt.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>The problem statement was then updated to further coincide with the research findings listed above.</p>

        <!-- 3. Point of View -->
        <h2>3. Point of View</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="user-personas"></span>
        <div>
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>User personas were created to connect the findings from the interviews I conducted to actual people who might use the app. I chose to create three different personas to acknowledge that people will be using this app for different
            purposes. I really wanted to make sure that these personas brought our users to life so I included their demographic information, activities they like to take part in, potential reasons for them using ScavApp, along with areas of
            motivation and frustrations with using the app. This information helped me to recognize and prioritize their needs as a user.</p>

          <h3>User Journeys</h3>
          <p>From these user personas, I developed user journeys to help understand the steps the user will need to complete in order to accomplish their goals along with the thoughts and emotions they may experience. By understanding the step by
            step processes as well as the users thoughts and emotions, I could truly put myself in the shoes of the users.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>Once I understood the goals and needs of the user, I created user flows to demonstrate all of the pages the user would need to work through to accomplish their goals. To make sure I included all of the necessary steps, I established
            the entry point and the success criteria then filled in the steps from there. These created the foundation needed to begin developing the information architecture of the application.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="information-architecture"></span>
        <div>
          <h3>Sitemapping & Card Sorting</h3>
          <p>A sitemap was created from the user flows to demonstrate how information will be grouped for the naviation within the app.</p>
          <div>
            <picture>

            </picture>
          </div>
          <p>Card sorting was then performed get insight from potential users on how information should be grouped within the app. This was conducted in order to understand how well the sitemap I created coincided with the thoughts of the users. After multiple cards were labelled with different topics relating to the app, potential users were asked to group these
            cards together in a way that made sense to them. The darker the color and the higher the percentage, the more these themes were grouped together. The information gained from the card sorting was then used to edit my original sitemap. Very few changes were made which helped to validate the sitemap I originally created.</p>

        <!-- 5. Prototype-->
        <h2>5. Prototype</h2>
        <p>Low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes were created using all of the information that was gathered and created in the previous steps. These wireframes were turned into prototypes to bring an element of interactivity and make it possible
          to
          perform user testing.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>Quick sketches were created to build a foundation of the core functionality of the app. The reason I started with sketckes was to make sure that a solid foundation was set. I did not want to get bogged down and distracted with the
            appearance of the app. A good foundation can make the difference between an app that only looks good and another app that looks good but is also user friendly.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Mid-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>Once the overall foundation was set, mid-fidelity wireframes were created using the program Balsamiq. These illustrated more functionality than the low-fidelity wireframes but did not have the the level of detail found in the
            high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

          <h3>High-Fidelity</h3>
          <p>The last stage was to create high-fidelity wireframes using AdobeXD. These wireframes incorporated all of the functionality as well as the UI experience. There were several factors that went into the UI of this app including, color theory, a
            grid system and more. These screens were mapped to create a prototype that was used for user testing.</p>

            <div>
          <h4>Color Theory</h4>
          <p>Based on Color Theory, I chose the color blue as my branding to envoke the feeling of trust. Users will be using this app to look for pre-made scavenger hunts so they need to trust that these are validated and correct when it comes time
            to play them.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Grid</h4>
          <p>I used an 8 grid to help with the alignment of each element. I made sure that information did not fall within the gutters of the grid.</p>

          <h4>Gestalt Laws of Grouping</h4>
          <p>Several of these laws were applied, such as proximity and similarity, to group elements in a way that was intuitive to the user.</p>

            <h4>IOS Human Interface Guidelines</h4>
          <p>These guidelines helped to create an UI experience which integrated my app seamlessly into the Apple platform. Some specific guidelines I applied were:</p>
          <div class="testtacklr-list">
            <ul>
              <li>Modality Sheet: Using a blurred background to help emphasize the pop up sheet.</li>
              <li>Icon Size: Standard size with a label.</li>
              <li>Navigational Feedback: Highlighing the icon to indicate to users where they are in the app.</li>
              <li>Scroll Bar: To indicate to users that this screen scrolls</li>
              <li>Search Bar: Having a way to clear the bar quickly and a cancel button to quickly cancel the search.</li>
            </ul>

<span class="anchor" id="usability-testing"></span>
          <div>
            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Usability testing was performed after the creation of my high fidelity prototype. User testing was used to identify pain points and areas of needed improvement before handing off the design to the developers. Five participants were read scenarios then asked to complete tasks using the prototype.</p>

            <h3>Affinity & Rainbow Mapping</h3>
            <p>The results from the high-fidelity usability tests were grouped together based on similar themes using affinity mapping. These themes were used in rainbow mapping to help illustrate the severity of the problem and to document possible
              solutions for these problems. From this spreadsheet, I was able to prioritize which issues to fix first using Jakob Nielsen's Error Severity Rating Scale. Those issues that were rated a "4" were usability issues that needed to be fixed
              before
              development.​​​​​​​</p>

            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p>After analyzing the results from the usability testing, changes were made to the prototype to address these pain points. Though changes were made there is always room for further iteration and improvement.</p>

            <h4>1. Colors</h4>
            <p>I changed colors to meet the contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. This helped to make the colors pop out more.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Labels</h4>
            <p>It is important to have labels for each text box. When the user begins to type they are still able to see what they are supposed to be typing in that box based on the label.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Placeholders</h4>
            <p>Having placeholders gives some guidance and instruction to the user on what goes in that input field.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Social Media Icons</h4>
            <p>I changed the icon colors to adhere to their universally known colors, increasing familiarity and recognition.
            </p>
            <h4>5. Error suggestions</h4>
            <p>Error suggestions provide information after an input error is detected to help guide the user. I also used color to help emphasize that an error has occurred.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Progress bar</h4>
            <p>I further blurred the progress bar to help increase the visibility.</p>

        <p>All of the elements used in the high-fidelity prototype were consolidated into a Design Style Guide so the engineering team and other designers on the project would have something to reference to regarding all of the design elements used. This document includes the typography, iconography, imagery, language, and much more.​​​​​​</p>
