        <h1>Portfolio Case Study</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I created this portfolio while completing the Frontend Development Course through Career Foundry in order to showcase my UX/UI and Frontend Development projects. This course taught me how to build a website from scratch over the course
          of 10 weeks. I learned about HTML, CSS, and a limited amount of JavaScript. The website endured user testing, accessibility assessments, and cross browser testing to ensure it was ready to go live. The programs I used included Atom,
          GitHub, Adobe XD, Linters, and HostGator.</p>
      </div>

      <div>

          <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In order to learn more about frontend development I signed up for a Frontend Development Course through Career Foundry. This course taught me the fundamentals of web design through the utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This
              course
              was completed over 10 weeks from November 2020 to January 2021.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Since I recently changed my career path from medicine to UX/UI Design, I wanted to have a way for potential employers to view the work I have created. Before this portfolio I was only able to promote myself through LinkedIn or Indeed.
              These modes, while useful, did not demonstrate who I am and what I am capable of on a more personal level. I wanted to be more than just another resume.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Through this portfolio I was hoping to further develop my online presence and have a platform to showcase my work in a way that demonstrates my skills as well as my personality. Not only did I want to have a portfolio, but I also
              wanted
              to
              understand the process behind creating a website. This information has always fascinated me and it will help me bridge the gap between designer and developer.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <!-- Process and Insights -->
          <h2>Process and Insights</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>The first step in this daunting task was to learn the HTML fundamentals. This included defining some of the basic terminology of elements, tags, and attributes, learning about the necessary elements needed for the foundation of a
              website, and how to include proper formatting.
            </p>
            <p>Once the foundational knowledge was set it was time to add the content. This content included elements such as the text, more advanced tags, and links which created a more complete and cohesive experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>Though the information of my portfolio was there, the user experience would not be the same without a little (or a lot) of styling. If learning one language wasn’t enough, it was time to learn the language of CSS - the purpose, the
              syntax, the functionality, and how to link it to the html. With the help of this language I was able to make my portfolio look more like a professional website.
            </p>
            <p>From there, since I started with a mobile first approach, I learned how to incorporate media queries to make my design responsive across difference screen sizes. I chose to accomodate for medium devices (640px to 1023px), large devices
              (1024px to 1439px), and extra large devices (1440 px and above) so my website would be responsive for a variety of devices. By the end of it all, I had a website that contained all of the necessary content, looked good, and was
              responsive.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>To further enhance the user experience, I used JavaScript to add subtle animations to my website. I chose to add animation to the navigation to add some playfulness, to my hero sections to immediately grab the users attention, and to
              the
              contact button to take the user through a slow scroll to my contact information. Though my knowledge in this program is still limited, I am excited to learn more about how to incorporate more JavaScript in my own website as well as
              future
              projects.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>Now that I had a website I needed to make sure that it was actually functional. In order to achieve this I ran some user testing with five different participants. The results from my scenario based testing can be seen below and it was
              analyzed using Jakob Nielsen's Severity Ratings.
            </p>

              </picture>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
            <p>With the help of user testing, I was able to formulate a plan on how I would like to improve on my website and the reasons for doing so.
            </p>
            <div class="understand">
              <ul>
                <div>
                  <li>Adjust links so the user knows what page they are on.</li>
                  <p>I need to adjust my code to make sure that when a link is clicked on it is changing colors so the user knows that page of the website they are on. I know I have this code already in Atom, but I think there is a possibility that I
                    have the same colors for both a clicked link and unclicked links. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <li>Adding a new page to showcase my resume.</li>
                  <p>This one will definitely take some time but there have been some portfolios I have seen that have their resume as it’s own page and I really like that format. I think that the way it is right now does not really make my resume
                    easily accessible. In order to achieve this I will need to create a whole new page for my website. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <li>Photo Size</li>
                  <p>I need to go through and make sure that my photos are not cut off of the page. Photos are more effective when you can see the whole thing. I am going to adjust the max width and height of my photos.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <li>Adding Drop Shadows</li>
                  <p>I think that adding drop shadows could enhance my portfolio by adding another dimension to it. I will need to create a class for the photos that I would like to have a drop shadow and then I will have to figure out the details of
                    the drop shadow.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <li>Adding Gifs</li>
                  <p>Though this was not brought up during my usability testing, I would like to add gifs of my prototypes so give the user a little snippet of my work. I will record me going through the prototype then upload the video to
                    SmartMockups. I will then need to research how to add this video to my portfolio.</p>
                </div>
              </ul>
            </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Code Quality, Accessibility & Cross Browser Testing</h3>
                <p>With my website almost complete, it was time to make sure that the code quality was up to par. This was done through the utilization of various linters for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once all of the errors were corrected, I tested my website on different browsers and a different screen sizes to ensure that no further edits were needed. Lastly, I wanted to make sure that my website achieved the AA standard for accessibility. This was done by using a color checker, making sure to have attributes for all of my photos, and more.
