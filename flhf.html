          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>Colorado is one of the fittest states in the country and there is no shortage of personal trainers or gyms to help satisfy these needs. With competition being fierce, personal trainers needs to do what they can to stand out from the
            rest. Personal trainer, Bridgett, owns Fight Like Hell Fitness. This business offers online and in-person personal training, group training, exercise prescriptions, nutrition coaching and supplementation education with an emphasis on
            kinesiology and corrective exercise. She is looking to
            expand her business and work on this passion full time. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The objective of this redesign is to understand business goals, competition, current website heuristics, and user needs then consolodate these aspects into an intuitive, user-centered website design that demonstrates her drive and
            passion for helping others achieve their fitness goals.</p>

            <h2>1. Understanding Business Goals</h2>
            <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
            <p>Not only do I want to help redesign this website but I want to make sure that it coincides with the business goals of Fight Like Hell Fitness. In order to gain more insights I conducted a stakeholder interview with the owner to
              understand her goals, taget audience, and opinions of the current website. </p>
            <p>From these interviews I learned that her business is still in the early stages and that she is looking to grow. She wants to help anyone who is willing to put in the effort and she wants to demonstrate to potential and current clients
              her
              unmatched drive to help people reach their goals. She offers a variety of services but she is struggling because her website is not receiving any traffic. She likes her testimonials but there are some flow and UI issues that she would
              like
              to fix.</p>

              <h2>2. Understanding the Competition</h2>
              <h3>S.W.C.D.UX.O. Profile</h3>
              <p>There is a plethora of gyms and personal trainers in the Colorado Springs area. I wanted to conduct a competitor analysis using the S.W.C.D.UX.O. outline to understand the strengths, weaknesses, content, design, user experience, and
                opportunities of direct and indirect competitors. For my direct competitors, I looked up the top personal trainers in Colorado Springs on Yelp. This would give me a good idea of the top competition in the area and what they offer. As
                for the
                indirect competitors, I chose top cross fit gyms in the area. The observations are consolidated in the table below.</p>

              <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
              <p>The findings from the competitor analysis were written on individual sticky notes then grouped based on common themes. </p>
              <div class="statement">
                <picture>
                  <source srcset="img/projects/flhf/affinity-map-before-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

                </picture>
              </div>
              <p>From these common themes I was able to deduce a variety of conclusions. Some of the conclusions that really stood out beyond the typical guidelines and are specific to the fitness industry are listed below: </p>
              <div class="testtacklr-list">
                <ul>
                  <li>Credibility is gained through reviews, testimonials, awards, certifications, and success stories.</li>
                  <li>Reviews need to be short and sweet and highlight main points.</li>
                  <li>Business is created by getting people to sign up or contact the trainer/gym. Different options are: multiple social media links, mailing list pop-up, giving step-by-step directions, using animation to call to action, having
                    contact submission forms
                    or phone number in view, letting them purchase packages.</li>
                  <li>Having pricing available will decrease user frustration because they will not have to call and take that additional step to find out that information.</li>
                  <li>Having a variety of services that serve and relate to a wide audience.</li>
                  <li>There needs to be enough information but not too much where the reader becomes overwhelmed.</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
              <p>Now that I understood the business goals and the competition, I evaluated the Fight Like Hell Fitness website on desktop and mobile to understand usability issues using knowledge of UX guidelines and best practices.</p>

              <h3>User Personas</h3>
              <p>All of the data was consolidated into user personas. By creating personas that were based on research, any design decisions based on these personas meant they were data driven. Three personas were created to (1)
                incorporate all of the research and (2) to represent different demographics and personalities within the target audience. These personas included their goals, needs, motivations, frustrations and activities to truely drive home the
                pain points and needs of potential clients.</p>

              <h3>Original Sitemap</h3>
              <p>To understand the original information architecture of this website I created a sitemap summarizing the navigation and content. There were issues that popped up immediately when analyzing the sitemap. Two of the most stark issues
                were (1) "Community" and "Social" are indistinguishable and (2) only two services are listed but she offers many other services. </p>

              <h3>Sitemap Redesign</h3>
              <p>Information from user personas and research findings were used to recreate the original sitemap. The navigation was simplified, the content was grouped in an intuitive manner, and all of the companies services and information were
                included. </p>

              <h3>Home Page</h3>
              <p>The original homepage provided very little information for the potential client. There was a short paragraph about the business then some information about two of the five services she provides. I wanted to create a homepage that really demonstrated the brand, was eye-catching, but also provided a summary of the business, the trainer, and the services provided so prospective clients where well informed.</p>

                  <p>Throughout the entire original website, there is only mention of virtual group classes and personal training. This was a huge problem considering FLHF offers so many more services. To simplify the navigation and to make sure all information was included, a quick list of the services were placed on the homepage and then they were described in detail under the "Services" tab of the navigation bar.</p>

                      <p>There were a couple places in the original website that had very lengthy testimonials. With what we know of UX Design, no one is going to read something that long. On the new homepage, I added very shortened versions of these testimonals to help potiential clients get the most valuable information out of current clients.</p>

I made sure that there was a footer on every page that had the links to her Facebook, Instagram, Moxie, and 1st Phorm. I also made sure that people had a way to contact FLHF on every page along instead of just relying on the "Contact" page.</p>
