        <div>
          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>Colorado is one of the fittest states in the country and there is no shortage of personal trainers or gyms to help satisfy these needs. With competition being fierce, personal trainers needs to do what they can to stand out from the
            rest. Personal trainer, Bridgett, owns Fight Like Hell Fitness. This business offers online and in-person personal training, group training, exercise prescriptions, nutrition coaching and supplementation education with an emphasis on kinesiology and corrective exercise. She is looking to
            expand her business and work on this passion full time. </p>

        <!-- 1. Business Goals -->
        <h2>1. Understanding Business Goals</h2>
        <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
        <p>Not only do I want to help redesign this website but I want to make sure that it coincides with the business goals of Fight Like Hell Fitness. In order to gain more insights I conducted a stakeholder interview with the owner to
          understand her goals, taget audience, and opinions of the current website. </p>
        <p>From these interviews I learned that her business is still in the early stages and that she is looking to grow. She wants to help anyone who is willing to put in the effort and she wants to demonstrate to potential and current clients her
          unmatched drive to help people reach their goals. She offers a variety of services but she is struggling because her website is not receiving any traffic. She likes her testimonials but there are some flow and UI issues that she would like
          to fix.</p>

        <!-- 2.Understanding the Competition -->
        <h2>2. Understanding the Competition</h2>
        <h3>S.W.C.D.UX.O. Profile</h3>
        <p>There is a plethora of gyms and personal trainers in the Colorado Springs area. I wanted to conduct a competitor analysis using the S.W.C.D.UX.O. outline to understand the strengths, weaknesses, content, design, user experience, and
          opportunities of direct and indirect competitors. For my direct competitors, I looked up the top personal trainers in Colorado Springs on Yelp. This would give me a good idea of the top competition in the area and what they offer. As for the
          indirect competitors, I chose top cross fit gyms in the area. The observations are consolidated in the table below.</p>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/flhf/competitor-analysis-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/flhf/competitor-analysis-lg.png" alt="S.W.C.D.UX.O. Profile">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
        <p>The findings from the competitor analysis were written on individual sticky notes then grouped based on common themes. </p>
        <div class="statement">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/flhf/affinity-map-before-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/flhf/affinity-map-before-lg.png" alt="Affinity Map Before">
          </picture>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/flhf/affinity-map-after-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/flhf/affinity-map-after-lg.png" alt="Affinity Map After">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <p>From these common themes I was able to deduce a variety of conclusions. Some of the conclusions that really stood out beyond the typical guidelines and are specific to the fitness industry are listed below: </p>
        <div class="testtacklr-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Credibility is gained through reviews, testimonials, awards, certifications, and success stories.</li>
            <li>Reviews need to be short and sweet and highlight main points.</li>
            <li>Business is created by getting people to sign up or contact the trainer/gym. Different options are: multiple social media links, mailing list pop-up, giving step-by-step directions, using animation to call to action, having contact submission forms
              or phone number in view, letting them purchase packages.</li>
            <li>Having pricing available will decrease user frustration because they will not have to call and take that additional step to find out that information.</li>
            <li>Having a variety of services that serve and relate to a wide audience.</li>
            <li>There needs to be enough information but not too much where the reader becomes overwhelmed.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 3.Understanding the Product -->
      <h2>3. Understanding the Product</h2>
      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Now that I understood the business goals and the competition, I evaluated the Fight Like Hell Fitness website on desktop and mobile to understand usability issues using knowledge of UX guidelines and best practices.</p>
      <div>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/projects/flhf/heuristic-eval-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

      <!-- 4. Next Steps-->
      <h2>4. Next Steps</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>User Interviews & Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>I want to understand people's perspectives on personal trainers as well as how people are using the current website to understand pain points and needs moving forward. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>User Personas & Task Analyses</h3>
        <p>At this point it will be time for me to take all of this information and create user personas. This will help me digest this information from the perspective of the user and help me design with the user in mind. I will then be able to work through user flows to show the steps a user might take to complete a task.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Sitemap Creation</h3>
        <p>Once I have all of foundational information, I will begin to develop the information architecture in the form of a sitemap. This will help me to group and structure the navigation and content throughout the website.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Wireframes & Prototyping</h3>
        <p>With the information architecture and sitemap in place I can begin doing wireframe sketches and creating prototypes.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Usability Testing & Iteration</h3>
        <p>The final stage will be to do an additional round of user testing to make sure that the original goals were met and the user pain points have been addressed.</p>
