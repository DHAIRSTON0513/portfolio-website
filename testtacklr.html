          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>To fully understand the scope and functionality of different flashcard applications that are currently available to users, I conducted a competitor analysis of Quizlet, Flash Cards, and FlashCardsGO. With this analysis, I created a
            spreadsheet that consolidated information about the applications themselves, their available features, and their overall usability. From all of this information, was able to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each application.</p>

          <p>Below are the features I found that really stood out to me and that I wanted to consider incorporating in my own application;</p>
          <div class="understand">
            <ul>
              <li>A variety of ways for users to study to accommodate different learning styles</li>
              <li> A community for sharing and learning</li>
              <li>The ability to formatting cards and upload photos</li>
              <li>Informative onboarding</li>
              <li> A uninterrupted learning experience (minimal distractions)</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>Before moving forward, I needed to know if my findings from the competitor analysis actually coincided with what my user needed. The last thing I would want to do is create an app off of my own assumptions rather than from data collected
            from actual users.

            I performed additional user research by interviewing college aged students on their study methods and experience with learning new vocabulary. The purpose of this was to step in the shoes of the target audience and understand their needs
            and goals when using technology for studying. </p>

            <h2>2. Point of View</h2>
            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>With all of the information gathered from my user research, I created my proto-persona, Sophia. Sophia was created to be a representation of the needs, goals, behaviors and pain points of my hypothesized user. When working day in and
              day out on a project, it can be all too easy to lose sight of the people we are actually creating for and just focus on the internal agenda of the company.</p>
            <p>Sophia is a 21 year old female who is studying pre-medicine at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is a very goal driven individual who maintains a strict schedule to balance her educational life, her professional life and her
              personal life.She needs effective and efficient study methods that make the most of her study time. She wants tools that let her review the material in different ways; not only to help drive the memorization of the material but also to
              keep her
              engaged and motivated.
              With such a busy schedule she would benefit from something to help her stay on task and remind her of her goals. </p>

            <div>
              <h3>User Stories</h3>
              <p>To further bring Sophia to life, I created user stories to transform her basic needs into functional requests. This helps me to solidify that I am solving actual problems for people based on the things they want to accomplish.</p>
              <div>
                <picture>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Job Stories</h3>
              <p>To take this a step further, I also created job stories. This helped me to understand Sophia’s needs but also the “why” behind these needs. At this point I understand, not only the functional needs, but the purpose behind these needs
                which provides an imperative framework for the development process.</p>

              <h3>Problem Statement & Hypothesis</h3>
              <p>I wrote a problem statement and a hypothesis statement to summarize my user research findings, user persona, user stories, and job stories. </p>

              <h3>Task Analysis & User Flow</h3>
              <p>Two different task analysis were developed to understand the step by step process required to complete a task.

                Different users may take different paths to accomplish the same goal. User flows were created to understanding the paths users may take to complete a task as well as identify any other paths they may take.

                I chose to outline the task flow and user flow for setting the details of a flashcard set and creating the flashcards themselves, as these are main functions of the app. </p>
