          <h2>Project Summary</h2>
          <p>TestTacklr is a flashcard application that aims to provide effective study methods that make the most of limited study time. Users are able to create study a variety of different flashcards and chose settings that help them stay on task
            and remind them of their study goals. This application also includes tools that let users review the material in different ways; not only to help drive the memorization of the material but also to keep them engaged and motivated. </p>

        <h2>1. Understand</h2>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>To fully understand the scope and functionality of different flashcard applications that are currently available to users, I conducted a competitor analysis of Quizlet, Flash Cards, and FlashCardsGO. With this analysis, I created a
          spreadsheet that consolidated information about the applications themselves, their available features, and their overall usability. From all of this information, was able to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each application.</p>

        <p>Below are the features I found that really stood out to me and that I wanted to consider incorporating in my own application;</p>
        <div class="understand">
          <ul>
            <li>A variety of ways for users to study to accommodate different learning styles</li>
            <li> A community for sharing and learning</li>
            <li>The ability to formatting cards and uploading photos</li>
            <li>Informative onboarding</li>
            <li> A uninterrupted learning experience (minimal distractions/ads)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Before moving forward, I needed to know if my findings from the competitor analysis actually coincided with what my user needed. The last thing I would want to do is create an app off of my own assumptions rather than from data collected
          from actual users. I performed additional user research by interviewing college aged students on their study methods and experience with learning new vocabulary. The purpose of this was to step in the shoes of the target audience and
          understand their needs
          and goals when using technology for studying. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <!-- 3. Point of View -->
        <h2>3. Point of View</h2>
        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>With all of the information gathered from my user research, I created my proto-persona, Sophia. Sophia was created to be a representation of the needs, goals, behaviors and pain points of my hypothesized user. When working day in and
          day out on a project, it can be all too easy to lose sight of the people we are actually creating for and, instead, just focus on the internal agenda of the company.</p>
        <p>Sophia is a 21 year old female who is studying pre-medicine at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is a very goal driven individual who maintains a strict schedule to balance her educational life, her professional life and her
          personal life. She needs effective and efficient study methods that make the most of her study time. She wants tools that let her review the material in different ways; not only to help drive the memorization of the material but also to
          keep her engaged and motivated. With such a busy schedule she would benefit from something to help her stay on task and remind her of her goals. </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>User Stories</h3>
          <p>To further bring Sophia to life, I created user stories to transform her basic needs into functional requests. This helps me to solidify that I am solving actual problems for people based on the things they want to accomplish.</p>
          <h3>Job Stories</h3>
          <p>To take this a step further, I also created job stories. This helped me to understand Sophia’s needs but also the “why” behind these needs. At this point I understand, not only the functional needs, but the purpose behind these needs
            which provides an imperative framework for the development process.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Problem Statement & Hypothesis</h3>
          <p>I wrote a problem statement and a hypothesis statement to summarize my user research findings, user persona, user stories, and job stories. </p>

        <h3>Task Analysis & User Flow</h3>
        <p>Before starting my wireframes, I needed to determine the information architecture that will provide structure to my application. Two different task analysis were developed to understand the step by step process required to complete a
          task. Since different users may take different paths to accomplish the same goal, user flows were created to understand the
          various paths users may take to complete a task. I chose to outline the task flow and user flow for setting the details of a flashcard set and creating the flashcards themselves as these are main functions of the app. </p>

        <h2>5. Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>With Sophia in mind and the information architecture in hand, it was time to sketch some low-fidelity wireframes. With low-fidelity wireframes I am able to focus on the foundation of the structure and navigation of my app before
          worrying about the visual design. I started with designing the sign in/sign up and onboarding wireframes. There were certain features that I wanted to incorporate in these wireframes.</p>
        <div class="understand">
          <ul>
            <li>Using other accounts (i.e. Google, Facebook, Twitter) to create an account with TestTacklr. This feature can really simplify the account creation process which in turn can result in a higher number of created accounts.</li>
            <li>Informative and efficient onboarding with the option to skip. Users should have the option to go through the onboarding process. In order to make sure not to lose the interest of the user, this onboarding needs to set a good
              foundation for the user but not be too overwhelming.</li>
          </ul>

          </picture>
          <p>One of the main features that Sophia needed was the ability to customize the settings of new study materials. She can document the date of the test, set certain days to study, get reminders to study, and receive a weekly progress
            report. Sophia also has the options of choosing different flashcard types to accommodate for different types of materials.</p>

          <h3> Prototype </h3>
          <p> Once all of the wireframes were created, I took pictures of them all, uploaded them into Pop by Marvel, then went through the process of connecting all of the pictures together to form a functional prototype.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <!-- 6. Test -->
        <h2>6. Test</h2>
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>Now I had a prototype, but was it useful? To determine the level of usefulness, I needed to assess it’s level of utility and usability. Utility is characterized by the availability of features and functionality for users to complete
          pertinent tasks while usability is defined by the overall user experience and their satisfaction with the application. If I have achieved both of these characteristics, then I have created a useful app. In order to assess TestTacklr’s
          usefulness, I conducted usability tests with three participants over FaceTime. The test plan is further described in the table below.</p>

          </picture>
          <h3>Findings</h3>
          <p>The findings from user testing was analyzed with the help of Jakob Nielsen’s Error Severity Rating Scale. As I went through all of the recordings from the testing, I wrote down different errors, observations, and comments that were
            made by the participant. I then assigned each item a severity number ranging from zero (not a usability issue) to four (usability catastrophe). This type of characterization helped me to understand the issues that I needed to
            prioritize. For example, through this testing I realized I made the huge mistake of not including any back buttons. This was assigned a four because I would need to fix this before I can release the application.</p>

        <p>This application was created while completing the Intro to UX Design Course through Career Foundry. If I were to ever revisit this project I would continue to improve on the prototype through additional usability testing and
          revisions, collect additional data through qualitative and quantitative research, and incorporate the UI experience.</p>
