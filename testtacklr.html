          <h1>Project Summary</h1>
          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>TestTacklr is a flashcard app that provides effective study materials and various study methods to help users maximize limited study time. Users are able to create a variety of different flashcards to accomodate for all kinds of study
            information that do not follow the standard flashcard. There are also settings that can be customized when creating a new study set to help users stay on task and remind them of their study goals. This application also includes tools that
            let users review the material in different ways; not only to help drive the memorization of the material but also to keep them engaged and motivated.</p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>With this being my first exposure to the UX world, this project introduced me to the role of being a UX designer and creating an app from scratch.</p>
          <h3>Duration</h3>
          <p>This project was self-paced, but the students were expected to complete the course within one month. I was able to complete it in two weeks. </p>

          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>To fully understand the scope and functionality of different flashcard applications currently available to users, I conducted a competitor analysis of Quizlet, Flash Cards, and FlashCardsGO. With this analysis, I created the
            spreadsheet below that consolidates information about the applications themselves, their available features, and their overall usability. From all of this information, I was able to evaluate and determine the strengths and weaknesses of
            each application.</p>

          <p>Below are the features that really stood out to me from my competitor analysis. These are items that I considered incorporating in my own application.</p>
          <div class="testtacklr-list">
            <ul>
              <li>A variety of ways for users to study to accommodate different learning styles</li>

              <li>The ability to format cards and upload photos</li>
              <li>Informative onboarding</li>
              <li> An uninterrupted learning experience (minimal distractions/ads)</li>

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>Before moving forward, I needed to know if my findings from the competitor analysis actually coincided with what my users needed. I performed additional research by interviewing college aged students on their study methods and experience
            with learning new vocabulary. The purpose of this was to step in the shoes of the target audience and
            understand their needs
            and goals when using technology for studying. I turned their responses into "doing," "feeling," and "thinking" statements so help summarize their thoughts and ideas.</p>

          <h2>3. Point of View</h2>
          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <p>With all of the information gathered from my user research, I created my proto-persona, Sophia. Sophia was created to be a representation of the needs, goals, behaviors and pain points of my hypothesized user.</p>
          <p>"Sophia is a 21 year old female who is studying pre-medicine at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is a very goal driven individual who maintains a strict schedule to balance her educational life, professional life and
            personal life. She needs effective and efficient study methods that make the most of her study time. She wants tools that let her review the material in different ways; not only to help drive the memorization of the material but also to
            keep her engaged and motivated. With such a busy schedule she would benefit from something to help her stay on task and remind her of her goals."" </p>

          <div>
            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>To further bring Sophia to life, I created user stories to transform her basic needs into functional requests. Writing these helped me understand functions that the users will want to accomplish so I can have a better idea of how to
              provide a solution.</p>
            <h3>Job Stories</h3>
            <p>To take this a step further, I also created job stories. This not only helped me to understand Sophia’s needs, but also the “why” behind these needs.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Problem Statement & Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>To summarize my user research findings, user persona, user stories, and job stories, I developed a problem statement as well as a hypothesis statement. These outlined the problem I was trying to tackle along with the possible solution.

          <h3>Task Analysis & User Flow</h3>
          <p>Before starting my wireframes, I needed to determine how I wanted the information architecture to be structured throughout the app. Two different task analysis were mapped out to understand the step by step process required to complete a
            task. Since different users may take different paths to accomplish the same goal, user flows were then created to understand the
            various paths users may take to complete a task. I chose to outline the task flows and user flows for 1) setting the details of a flashcard set and 2) creating the flashcards themselves, as these are main functions of the app. </p>

          <h2>5. Prototype</h2>
          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <p>With Sophia in mind and the information architecture in hand, it was time to sketch some low-fidelity wireframes. With low-fidelity wireframes I was able to focus on the foundation of the structure and navigation of my app before
            worrying about the visual design. I started with designing the sign in/sign up and onboarding wireframes. There were certain features that I wanted to incorporate in these wireframes, as listed below.</p>
          <div class="understand">
            <ul>
              <li>Using other accounts (i.e. Google, Facebook, Twitter) to create an account with TestTacklr. This feature can really simplify the account creation process which in turn can result in a higher number of accounts made.</li>
              <li>Informative and efficient onboarding with the option to skip. In order to make sure not to lose the interest of the user, this onboarding needs to set a good
                foundation for the user but not be too overwhelming. Though we would like for users to go through the onboarding, they should have the option of whether or not they want to go through the onboarding process.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>

              <img src="img/projects/testtacklr/onboarding-lg.png" alt="Onboarding" class="no-border no-shadow">
            </picture>
            <p>Now on to actually making a study set. One of the main features that Sophia needed was the ability to customize the settings of new study materials. Through our system, she can document the date of the test, set certain days to study,
              get reminders to study, and receive a weekly progress
              report. Sophia also has the option of choosing different flashcard types to accommodate for different types of materials for when she is ready to make her flashcards.</p>

            <h3> Prototype </h3>
            <p> Once all of the wireframes were created, I took pictures of them all, uploaded them into Pop by Marvel. I then connected and mapped out all of the pictures to form the functional prototype below.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <!-- 6. Test -->
          <h2>6. Test</h2>
          <h3>User Testing</h3>
          <p>Now I had a prototype, but was it useful? To determine the level of usefulness, I assessed it’s level of utility and usability. Utility is characterized by the availability of features and functionality for users to complete
            pertinent tasks. Usability is defined by the overall user experience and their satisfaction with the application. If I achieved both of those characteristics, I created a useful app. In order to assess TestTacklr’s
            usefulness, I conducted usability tests with three participants over FaceTime. The test plan is further described in the table below.</p>
          <div>

            </picture>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>The findings from user testing was analyzed with the help of Jakob Nielsen’s Error Severity Rating Scale. As I went through all of the recordings from the testing, I wrote down different errors, observations, and comments that were
              made by the participant. I then assigned each item a severity number ranging from zero (not a usability issue) to four (usability catastrophe). This type of characterization helped me to understand the issues that I needed to
              prioritize. For example, through this testing I realized I made the huge mistake of not including any back buttons. This was assigned a four because I would need to fix this before I can give it to the development team.</p>

          <p>This application was created while completing the Intro to UX Design Course through Career Foundry. If I were to ever revisit this project I would continue to improve on the prototype through additional usability testing and
            revisions, collect additional data through qualitative and quantitative research, and incorporate the UI experience.</p>
