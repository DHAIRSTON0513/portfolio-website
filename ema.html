        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>Summit Dermatology is a private practice of three dermatologists and fifteen employees. In 2021 they chose to switch to a new electronic medical records (EMR) software from eClinicalWorks to EMA of Modernizing Medicine due to the
            inefficiencies and lack of user-centered design of eCW. Modernizing Medicine’s EMA is a click based software meant to save medical professionals time when collecting patient information. The software base is provided but it is up to the
            practice to customize it in a way that coincides with their workflow and needs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The objective of this UX research project was to understand the software capabilities and limits of EMA and how to customize it to apply to the procedures and workflows of the medical assistants, nurses, and practitioners of Summit
            Dermatology.

        <!-- 1.Preparation -->
        <h2>1. Preparation</h2>
        <p>The first steps in preparing for this project was to understand Modernizing Medicine’s product for dermatology specific practices. I joined the Modernizing Medicine University and took all of the courses aimed at teaching users how to use
          the product. These courses consisted of videos, documents, and quizzes aimed at demonstrating the step-by-step processes to achieve tasks (i.e. scheduling a patient, taking a patient’s history, documenting exam and diagnosis, etc.). My
          research included both the administrative side as well as the medical side to understand the entire picture of this product’s workflow.</p>

        <p>After learning how the baseline product worked, I read the entire user manual to understand how this product could be customized to work specifically for Summit Dermatology. Some of the main areas of interest were:
        </p>
        <div class="ema-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Workflow Management</li>
            <li>Room Numbers</li>
            <li>Call Buttons</li>
            <li>Protocols</li>
            <li>Tasks</li>
            <li>Staff Groups</li>
            <li>Document Management</li>
            <li>Kiosks</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Since these were areas of customization, I needed to understand how these could be used and tailored to increase the productivity and efficiency throughout the practice.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <!-- 2. Observation -->
        <h2>2. Observation, Pain Points, Action, & Iteration</h2>
        <p>Since I worked at Summit Dermatology for several years before switching EMR systems I had a good understanding of their workflows but I did not understand how these needs would be integrated into this new EMR system. In the months before
          going live with the new system I trained and observed the employees as they used the new system. I observed the current processes, identified the pain points with these processes, came up with a solution for these pain points based on the
          customization options, then I iterated those solutions after additional user testing to ensure that the product was useful to the practice.</p>
        <h3>Workflow Management</h3>
        <h4>Observation</h4>
        <p>Pathology results are sent electronically to the physicians in EMA so they can review the results and decide the next steps for the patient. That information is then sent to the triage department through EMA. They view
          this information on the pending plan completion page of the EMA website where there are thirteen different columns (i.e. date, patient name, location, result, etc.) listed. The triage department uses this page to see the pathology
          results of different procedures, what further action needed to be taken, whether or not a patient was contacted, and what came from that contact.</p>
        <h4>Pain Point</h4>
        <p>When speaking with the triage department, they expressed their frustration with this page. Not only was it overwhelming to see all of this information on a single page but they had to click into the individual patient’s
          chart to see what was already done (i.e. if a phone call was already made).
        </p>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/ema/pathology-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/ema/pathology-lg.png" alt="Pathology Page">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>One of the customizable options was adding a list of workflows. A list of five options as created to indicate different actions the triage nurse might take. After completing a certain action, the triage nurse would select a
          workflow. This would appear in one of the columns to indicate a quick note to the other triage nurses what was done.</p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/workflow-short-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/workflow-short-lg.png" alt="First Workflow List">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>After further observation, it became apparent that this list was not inclusive enough. In other words, it did not have enough options to choose from that would give a clear indication of what occurred. For example,
          one of the initial workflow options was simply “left voice message.” The policy of the practice was, after two unsuccessful attempts to contact the patient, they had to send a letter to the patient. This meant that the nurses needed to
          know if this was the first or second contact to the patient. </p>
        <h4>Iteration</h4>
        <p>From this information, the workflow list was expanded to include more options so the employees could communicate properly about the status of that patient and their pathology report.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Room Availability</h3>
        <h4>Observation</h4>
        <p>Before switching to EMA, a superbill (a document used to keep track of billing codes and diagnoses) was printed for every single patient scheduled for the day. When the patient checked in, the receptionist would put the superbill up for
          the medical assistant to grab. In the top right corner of this superbill the medical assistant would write the room number for the physician so they would know which room the patient was in.
        </p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/room-number-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/room-number-lg.png" alt="Superbill Room Number">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Pain Point</h4>
        <p>There were not going to be any more superbills for the medical assistants to write on once they switched over to EMA. Also, when working with EMA there were no room numbers available. These needed to be added and customized in order for
          the providers to know which room their patient was in.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Room numbers were added for both locations. The software gave the option of choosing whether or not the room could be used for multiple patients rather than just one patient. By saying that it was for a single patient, anytime someone
          selected that room, it would be taken off the list so the other medical assistants could not chose the same room. This is the action I chose to take as it would make it clear to all of the medical assistants which rooms were in use.</p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/room-list-short-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/room-list-short-lg.png" alt="First Room List">
            </picture>
          </div>
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/room-options-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/room-options-lg.png" alt="Room Options">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>There were two issues that arose from the original way this was done. First, if the patient did not check out with the receptionists, the room would still show that it was in use. This meant that, even though that room was ready to be
          used, the medical assistants were not aware of that. Second, there were several times that the patients wanted to go back into a room together. Sometimes it was a parent and a minor or two elderly spouses who felt more comfortable going
          back together. Whatever their reason, it was impossible to show that the second patient was taken back to a room which confused the workflow.
        </p>
        <h4>Iteration</h4>
        <p>Two additional rooms were added to the lists for both locations: “Checking Out” and “Double Roomed.” These were set up in a way differently than the others so that they were not reserved for just one person. If there was a delay in the
          check out process or if the patient walked out without checking out, the medical assistant could assign that patient to the “Checking Out” room so that the other room would be available again and the other medical assistants knew that this
          patient had been taken care of and was leaving. If a medical assistant chose “Double Roomed” it would indicate to the other assistants and physicians that this patient was taken care of and roomed with another patient.</p>
        <div class="statement">

            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Call Button - "Patient Ready"</h3>
        <h4>Observation</h4>
        <p>Before switching to EMA the medical assistants would set the superbills on the counter to indicate to the physicians that a patient had been roomed and were ready to be seen.
        </p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/clipboards-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/clipboards-lg.png" alt="Clipboard Placement">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Pain Point</h4>
        <p>There was nothing physical for the medical assistants to use to indicate that the patients were ready for the physicians. Instead they were having to track down the physicians to verbally inform them. They were spending too much time
          trying to find the physicians and waiting for them to come out of a different patient’s room to let them know their next patient was ready.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p> A call button was created in the system so the medical assistant could send the physician a push notification associated with the patient’s chart, letting the physician know that the patient was ready for the exam.
        </p>
        <div class="statement">
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/projects/ema/call-button-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/projects/ema/call-button-lg.png" alt="Call Button">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>The outcome of this was successful. The medical assistant would send the call button once they were finished with getting the patient’s history and the physician was immediately notified on their own iPad. </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Call Buttons - Action Needed</h3>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
      <p>Since eCW was not a clickable software the medical assistants accompanied the physician into the exam room to scribe the encounter. EMA, on the other hand, was a paperless system and was made for the physician to document their encounters on
        their own. A medical assistant only accompanied the physician depending on staff availability, physician preference, and the complexity of the patient.</p>
      <h4>Pain Point</h4>
      <p>When the medical assistants were in the room with the physician they knew right away what the plan of action was and if they needed to do something further (i.e. draw up medicine for injections, set up for a biopsy, etc.). Now that they were
        not always in the room they were not aware of what needed to be done. This resulted in the physicians trying to track down the medical assistant to take care of these things so they could move on to their next patient.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Additional call buttons were created specifically for the physicians so they could send a push notification back to the medical assistant with instructions on what things needed to be completed.
      </p>
      <div class="statement">
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/ema/action-needed-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

          </picture>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>This worked well to notify the medical assistants but the next problem was that the medical assistant had no way of telling the provider that they were done setting up and the patient was ready to see them again.</p>
      <h4>Iteration</h4>
      <p> Even more call buttons were created to make sure that there was clear communication between the medical assistants and the physicians.
      </p>
      <div class="statement">
        <div>

          </picture>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Protocols</h3>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
      <p>There was a lot of redundancy with most patients. Of course there were patients that required unique treatment but most of the patients adhered to a similar foundation of treatment. It is usually from this foundation that individual
        treatments were built off of.
      </p>
      <h4>Pain Point</h4>
      <p>This meant that the physician and/or medical assistant was putting in the same information over and over. For example, melanoma skin checks required the physician to check all parts of the body for suspicious spots. For each patient they
        would have to indicate the locations they checked in the exam portion of the note even though it was the same for every melanoma skin check.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Protocols were created to help reduce this redundancy and to increase efficiency of documenting the patient encounter. Protocols were created by pre-setting the exam, impression, plan, and follow-up for a variety of different visit types. A
        medical assistant or physician could then apply that protocol to their specific patient and it would populate these presets so they would not have go through the chart and add each of these details. These protocols were also customized for
        the different physicians since they practiced slightly different from one another.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/ema/protocol-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/ema/protocol-lg.png" alt="Protocols">
          </picture>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>This helped to increase the efficiency of charting because it would fill out the majority of the chart for the physician. All they would have to do is add any individual treatment plans that came up. As more time went on it became apparent
        that there were more visit types that could benefit from protocols.
      </p>
      <h4>Iteration</h4>
      <p> By the end of the iteration phase, twenty-nine protocols were created for a wide variety of visit types and were also physician specific.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick Tasks</h3>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
      <p>Not only was there redundancy in the visits with the patients but there was redundancy in the back office as well, specifically in the triage department. The triage department handled patient phone calls, prescription refills, pathology/lab
        results, prior authorizations and much more.
      </p>
      <h4>Pain Point</h4>
      <p>Anything the triage department did had to be documented into the patient’s chart. They spent a lot of time typing the same things over and over, such as “lab results were attached to patient’s chart for review.”
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Quick tasks were created in order to auto populate the majority of the information. By selecting the desired quick task it populated the details, notes, priority and who it needed to be assigned to.
      </p>
      <div class="statement">
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/projects/ema/quick-task-sm.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/projects/ema/quick-task-lg.png" alt="Quick Tasks">
          </picture>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>The triage department expressed that they were thrilled with these quick tasks but asked that more be added to aid in other workflow needs.
      </p>
      <h4>Iteration</h4>
      <p> More quick tasks were created with time as more and more redundant situations arose.
      </p>

      <h3>Staff Groups</h3>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
      <p>Whenever someone tried to send a message or a task to numerous employees they would have to type out and select each of the employee’s names.</p>
      <h4>Pain Point</h4>
      <p>If it was a message meant for the entire office they would have to select all eighteen names. It was extremely time consuming and inefficient for the employees.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Employees were bunched together in staff groups depending on either their department, position, or leadership role. Some of these staff groups included “Providers,” “Medical Assistants,” “Admin Staff.”</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>The staff enjoyed the ease of adding staff groups to messages but it was difficult for them to remember the names of all of the staff groups.</p>
      <h4>Iteration</h4>
      <p> Some of the names of the staff groups were changed to be more intuitive and reference guides were given to the staff for them to glance at when selecting the appropriate group.</p>


      <h3>Document Management</h3>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
      <p>Summit Dermatology relied entirely on paper. When a new patient would arrive to the clinic they would be given a clipboard with seven different pieces of paper for them to fill out. These included financial consents, patient demographics,
        and medical history. Whenever a procedure was done, the medical assistant would also have to get a written consent from the patient before starting the procedure.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Pain Point</h4>
      <p>Patients regularly complained about the amount of paperwork and the redundancy of the information on the paperwork. A lot of time was spent by both the admin staff and medical assistants manually entering this information. Since this was
        manually being entered there was a lot of room for mistakes and typos. All of these documents also had to be scanned into the patient’s chart which was extremely time consuming.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Kiosks were customized and tailored for the practice so that when a patient came into the office they could enter all of their own information into their own chart. All of the other documents were edited and turned into PDFs. In Adobe, EMA
        specific labels were added to text fields so when the document was pulled up in EMA the majority of the information was pre populated. For example, by adding the text field “AUTO_PatientNameFull” the patient’s full name would be populated
        when pulled up in the patient’s chart.
      </p>

      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>Patients were taking a very long time with the Kiosk which was frustrating to them and put the physicians behind schedule. Some documents were in PDF format in EMA while others were still in paper format. This was tedious for the staff
        because they had to remember which ones were in the system and for the ones that were not in the system they had to scan them in.
      </p>
      <h4>Iteration</h4>
      <p> The Kiosk was changed to only ask information that was needed by our specific practice which decreased the amount of information the patient had to document in the system. A total of 148 PDF forms with EMA specific labels were uploaded into
        the system to reduce paper waste and increase the efficiency of document management. </p>

      <h2>3. Results</h2>
      <p>Through observations, identification of pain points, solution implementation, user testing, and iteration I was able to effectively customize the EMR software to coincide with the workflows and needs of the practice. This ultimately resulted
        in an increase in productivity and efficiency and a decrease in technological frustrations for the employees and patients of Summit Dermatology. </p>
